# Serpentine
A simple snake game, that will soon have many improvements over the original.

I intend to make it follow all the same rules as the original snake, but with some additions:

- I want the grid to be able to be dynamically resized based on the size of the window.
    - However when the game is in session the player should not be able to do this, there needs to be a before game phase, where the player is able to resize the window
      how they wish, and the game will start as soon as they press an arrow key.
    - The larger the window, the more length is added per piece of food to maintain a decent challenge
- I would like a mode where the edges loop back around to the other side, like PacMan.
